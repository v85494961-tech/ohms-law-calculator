# Ohm’s Law Calculator

This project is a simple engineering calculator based on **Ohm’s Law**.  
It allows users to calculate **Voltage, Current, or Resistance** when two values are known.

##  Theory
Ohm’s Law states that:

V = I × R

where:
- V is voltage (volts)
- I is current (amperes)
- R is resistance (ohms)

##  Tools Used
- Python

##  How It Works
1. The user selects the quantity to calculate  
2. The program requests the required inputs  
3. The correct electrical value is computed and displayed

## Example Output

##  Purpose
This project was created to reinforce **basic electrical engineering concepts** and practice **programming logic**.

##  Future Improvements
- Add error handling
- Add a graphical interface
- Extend to power calculations
